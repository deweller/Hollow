Hollow
=======

Hollow is flat file blog script powered by PHPixie.

To create a blogpost, just add a .md file to the /posts folder.
To add a post category, just create a subfolder inside /posts and add your file there.
Remember that GitHub has a very cool Markdown editor, so you can write posts using github alone.

Hollow was created to create a multiplayer blogging platform. All posts submitted to this repo will appear
at http://hollow.phpixie.com . If you feel more like coding than writing you can make Hollow better and make all the people who
post blogposts happier.
